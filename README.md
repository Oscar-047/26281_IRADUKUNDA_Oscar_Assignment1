## My info
- Name: IRADUKUNDA Oscar
- Student ID: 26281
## What I Did

I created folders and files using Linux commands:

- Made a folder structure: home → myclass → practice → with folders like command, else, and p1
- Inside p1, made more folders: Hi → p3 → Here
- Created files: info, Hello, hereweAre, and P3 using the touch command
- Practiced moving between folders using cd command
- Used ls -la to see folder contents
- Copied files using cp command

## Why I Did It

- To learn how Linux organizes files and folders
- To understand the difference between relative and absolute path
- - To practice basic Linux commands that are used in real jobs
- To complete my course assignment requirements
- To prepare for working with servers and systems

## What I Learned

- How to create folders inside other folders using mkdir -p
- How to create empty files using touch
- The difference between relative paths (like ../../folder) and absolute paths (like /home/user)
- How to navigate through folders using cd command
- How to copy files to different locations
- How to see detailed folder contents with ls -la
- Basic Git commands to save and share my work

I now feel comfortable creating and managing files in Linux, which is important for IT jobs.
To create this file in Git Bash:
bash
# Go to your repository
cd ~/Desktop/Introduction_to_linux
